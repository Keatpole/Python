# Astroneer Lookup
Astroneer Lookup is a program I made so I could keep track on what resources I had to get. But I decided to publish it.

## Features:
- Write any resource or building name and the program will show you the *exact* way to make it. Sources: [Buildings](https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Items) / [Resources](https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Resources)
- Use commands like "/items" and "/buildings" to show you all items & buildings in the game.
- You can add your own resources or buildings by downloading the source code and adding lines of code (Python experience recommended)

## Notes:
- This should work on all operating systems but I can't check.
- If you find a bug, create an Issue (if you just want to report it) or a Pull Request (if you want to fix it yourself) you can do this by scrolling all the way up and clicking "Issues" or "Pull requests" depending on what you want to do. I will try to look into it when I can.
